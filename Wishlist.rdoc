== SUGGESTIONS

* added a mechanism for "ignoring" blank lines, i.e.,
  * not include the margin of blank lines in the minimum calculation
  * let them untouched (i.e., unprocessed)
  * possible implementation:
      re = Regexp.new '^\s{' + n.to_s + '}(\S+)$'
      s.gsub(re,'\1')
    instead of
      re = Regexp.new '^\s{' + n.to_s + '}'
      s.gsub(re, '')
  * re-benchmark to make sure it does not hurt performance and performance
    figures in README are still valid
